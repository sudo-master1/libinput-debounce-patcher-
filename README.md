# libinput-debounce-patcher
DISCLAIMER: I do NOT update the releases tab. Please kindly download the file from the source — the file is just a .sh script, not the actual source code!

So… I heard you want to play BedWars on your Linux machine, but your CPS is stuck at 6 or 7 max, while you can get 12 on Windows. I patched that, so you don’t have to go back to the prison of Windows just to play your favorite game — or for any other reason.

I used ChatGPT to check and troubleshoot the code.

I live in India and English is not my native language, so please ignore any mistakes.

This is meant for Linux only.
